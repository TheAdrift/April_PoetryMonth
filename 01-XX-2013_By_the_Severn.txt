You,
rolling, writhing, serpentine
crowned in foam
sliding in a school of your fellows
right to left
in a narrow band

This image is poingant:
an empty bridge
bleached gray with sun
or grass browned by cold
crossing a ditch, among trees
at the shore of a river
in a park in Annapolis
very far from home.

Where the sun darkens for clouds
I am conscious of the warmth, in absence,
wanting it to return but
too tired to miss it
or to conjure up
allegories of a woman's skin.
I am weary of lover-songs and heart-strings,
but I do not wish to be weary;

I wish to be twenty,
and have all the songs yet before me
and strings yet to pluck and strum,
and simply to make better choices.
