If I were not king of an infinite sea
I would choose serfdom on a picnic table
with a view toward a bridge and a hill of tall grass
or be duke of a small house in the country
with a yard, and a dog, and a woodlot in back.

Such things have limitation, definition, specificity.

But I am king, and my domain is vast.
My will propagates to infinity, and the sea takes it--
it takes also things I might will, so I will none of them;
I have all tables, and so I have less than one.
I contain all houses, all woodlots, each dog and all countries,
and so I have none
and would not know it if one touched me
as a wave on an infinite sea.
