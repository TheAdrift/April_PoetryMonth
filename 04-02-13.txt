Something in a southwest wind
in the north, in Winter
(she is April now but frigid,
keening, screaming,
this Wind. Winter she remains
and Winter I will call her still.)
that sharpens the brain
as it dulls the body.
This is, to myself, an anti-romance;

I say, "Self! This does not become us.


I yearn, though am loved;
hunger, though am fed;
it is never enough,
so I must ask for less.

I disavow it! I disclose it!
I shirk it, shrug it from my shoulders
falling like a mantle to the earth;
I disrobe it!
Stand unencumbered and rattling,
naked and withered in the Wind
and let her lash my hollow body."

I can not.

Would I were but a stack of bones,
unfleshed.
But I am meat, and fat,
blood, sinew, and breath,
and it is neither sweet,
nor bitter.
