We are come upon the flood season,
o brown and roiling river
o swollen, turbid creek.

Dust, winter's salt and sand
from midnight trucks slumping
into cracks and gutters
into pothole floors,
carried by the adiabat
rolling down the hill
through empty streets.

Our sun visits us again, and lingers,
comes early for breakfast
and remains for supper,
tempting us to our porches and on strolls

by the swollen, rolling river
where it crossed a wrinkled creek,
and makes the rust lovely
in the golden hour

where the East-West way
crossed the North-South way
on a spine of railroad iron
drawn and quartered,
tanning in the sun.
