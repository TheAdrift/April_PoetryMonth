	"Did you know,"

I asked her, winding
through a twilit valley
under waxing crescent,

	"there are mountains
	on the moon
	from which the sun never sets?"

A smirk, as she turns
the wheel, saying,

	"Heaven thoughts again?"

She meant an exchange
before dusk, when I
opined from a fallen
trunk, that,
	provided an afterlife, I hoped
	it would include

	sundown from a globular cluster,

	the sound of an apatosaur
		breathing,

	the odor of a young earth
		covered in ferns,
	
	a bodily descent into
	the Great Red Storm,
	
	reading poetry by Charon light.

"No," I say, smiling wider,

	"I'll touch the moon before I die."
